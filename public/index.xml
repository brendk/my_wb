      <description>Following frequent claims from American politician that climate change was a hoax, we decided to do an unbiased investigation of this controversial topic.Records show that global temperature is rising at an alarming pace, but is it only a short-term phenomenon, or a lasting trend ?We will use our statistical tools and knowledge to assess global warming based on data published by NASA about the Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere.</description>

      <description>Is there a significant difference between the salaries of men and women at Omega Group PLC ?Following the release of Omega Group PLC salary data, a quick analysis revealed that men executives salaries were USD 8â€™700 higher on average.
As it seems to be a considerable difference, we will investigate whether women executives are being discriminated in this company.
Shall we find a significant difference between the two groups, we will look at potential explanations to determine if other factors than gender can explain this difference.</description>

      <description>Executive SummaryThe goal of this project is to assess the ability of the Carhart 4 factor model in explaining stock returns. More precisely, we want to quantify the impact of Covid-19 on this accuracy.Are financial markets driven by factors during the pandemic ? What about previous crisis ?
The Carhart four-factor modelThe Carhart four-factor model is a multifactor model used to explain securities returns.It is an extension to the Fama-French three-factor model, designed by Eugene Fama and Keneth French in 1992, including an additional factor: the momentum.</description>
